\section{\scshape Coursework}
\vspace{-2mm}
Completing large and complex projects, such as a blog or implementing dynamic memory management,
has helped me learn how to quickly write efficient and maintainable code.
\vspace{3mm}
\begin{itemize}
 \item Languages: {\bfseries Python}, Java, C, SQL, Haskell, Prolog, VBA
 \item Web: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL
 \item Concepts: Object Oriented Design, Data Structures, Algorithms, Operating Systems
\end{itemize}
\vspace{-3mm}
\section{\scshape Self-taught Skills}
\vspace{-2mm}
I quickly become proficient in new programming languages and technologies through individual study,
and I enjoy challenging myself to learn new skills.
\vspace{3mm}
\begin{itemize}
 \item Languages: {\bfseries Ruby}, \CPP, \CS, \textls{\LaTeX}, MatLab
 \item Web: Rails, SASS, PostgreSQL
 \item Experienced Vim user, Ubuntu/Linux, Git
 \item Visual Studio, Unity3D, Adobe CS6, Autodesk ECS
\end{itemize}

\vspace{-3mm}
\section{\scshape Projects}
\vspace{-2mm}

\begin{itemize}
 \item Developing an automated test generator for Python, working with another section leader remotely. We use GitHub to
 manage and review each other's code, as well as keep track of open issues and feature requests. It produces runnable
 scripts that students and section leaders can use to test and grade programs. I focus on the
 area that does the testing and grading, in addition to the Qt GUI frontend. Our codebase is
 completely unit tested.
 \item Built a 2D Tower Defense game in Java, complete with networked two-player, sounds, and animation. Worked on 
 a team of four, using GitHub to manage our code. I developed the majority of the project, focusing on the
 overall design, game logic/mechanics, and visuals.
 \item Created a blog application using PHP, JavaScript, and MySQL. It allows for posts in
 multiple categories, and comments on those posts. In a short period of time I learned how to deal with
 security and keeping data safe, designing/using a database, and understanding AJAX and asynchronous programming.
\end{itemize}
